			<h1>Phylum-level Analysis Can Distinguish Skin Microbial Communities </h1>
			<p>
				Here's some text with an example of a link out to a reference
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8817/">[1]</a>.

				Here's some text you def shouldn't plagiarize b/c it doesn't related to your actual
				project and I wrote it so it will be obvious.
				Fierer et al. compared microbial communities on the fingertips and computer keyboards of
				3 individuals, demonstrating that differences in microbiomes between individuals were far 
				greater than differences between individuals [2]. Microbial classification was performed by 
				first clustering sequences to form operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which are a specific 
				taxonomic indicator, approximately equivalent to the species level [2]. 
				OTUs were then compared to a sequence database to assign taxonomy [2]. 
				Comparisons between communities at different skin and keyboard sites were calculated using 
				Principal Components Analysis (PCA) based on Unifrac distances [2]. Unifrac is a metric that 
				accounts for phylogenetic relationships between organisms â€“ this means that two communities may not 
				contain the same organisms, but if they contain similar organisms, they are considered to be more 
				closely related [3].
